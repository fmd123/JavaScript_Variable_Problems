//1.

//Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of healthy weight.
//It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and a height in feet and inches and displays the user\'s BMI value. To convert the users weight in pounds to their weight in kilograms you will need to use the fact that there are 2.2 pounds in one kilogram.

var weight = prompt("How much do you weigh in pounds?");

var feet = prompt("How many feet?")

var inches = prompt("How many inches?");


var totalinches = (feet*12) + parseFloat(inches);

var weightkg = weight/2.2;

console.log(weightkg);

var heightm = totalinches*(2.54/100);
console.log(heightm);

var bmi = weightkg /(heightm * heightm);

console.log(bmi);

//2.

//The temperature T in degrees Celsius (°C) is equal to the temperature T in degrees Fahrenheit (°F) minus 32, times 5/9.
//Write a program which prompts the user enter temp in celsisu, and
//displays the temperature in farenheit.
//3.Add Kelvin to the previous program

var celsius= prompt ("What is temperature in Celsius?");
var fahrenheit = (celsius * (9/5)) + 32;
console.log(fahrenheit);

var Kelvin = parseFloat(celsius) + 273.15;

console.log(Kelvin);
//Don't need to do parseFloat in the fahrenheit equation because by time + sign shows up the celsius string has already been turned into a number by multiplying it by 9/5. 

//4.Create a program which prompts the user to enter five test scores. Then, output the average of the five test scores.

var testscore1 = prompt("Please enter score 1");
var testscore2 = prompt("Please enter score 2");
var testscore3 = prompt("Please enter score 3");
var testscore4 = prompt("Please enter score 4");
var testscore5 = prompt("Please enter score 5");

var average = (parseFloat(testscore1) + parseFloat(testscore2) + parseFloat(testscore3) +parseFloat(testscore4) + parseFloat(testscore5)) / 5;


console.log(average);
